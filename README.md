# Cloud Computing coursework

The system supports estimating the value of pi accurate to a specifiable number of digits using Monte-Carlo method and the costs associated with it. The system written in Python is deployed on Google App Engine, uses AWS Lambda and Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) to estimate the values of pi. The scalable services Lambda and EC2 offer user specifiable computing resources on demand to carry out the analysis. 

The results are displayed along with a Line chart using Chart.JS reporting the values of Pi against values of Math.pi in Python with respect to the reporting rate specified.

The costs incurred for the scalable services are displayed for each estimate of pi. The front end is kept as simple as possible as per the requirements of the coursework.

### Key Words: Python, AWS Lambda, AWS EC2, Google App Engine, Boto3, Chart.JS
